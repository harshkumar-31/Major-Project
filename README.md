# Major-Project
Proposed a Music recommendation system based on human emotions which consists of modules- face detection, extraction of features, emotion recognition and recommender using concept of Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
train_CNN.py used for training of the cnn model to successfully classify enotions.
load_and_process.py is used to add the FER-2013 dataset to the CNN model for training.
cnn.py is used for displaying the architecture of the CNN layer(mini-xcpetion architecture)
Facial expression is detected using just the application.py file.
Successfull capture of emotion and then recommendation of music is done using application_sound.py file.
